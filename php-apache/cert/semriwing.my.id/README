`[cert name]/privkey.pem`  : the private key for your certificate.
`[cert name]/fullchain.pem`: the certificate file used in most server software.
`[cert name]/chain.pem`    : used for OCSP stapling in Nginx >=1.3.7.
`[cert name]/cert.pem`     : will break many server configurations, and should not be used
                 without reading further documentation (see link below).
